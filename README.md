## Real-Time Body Gesture Detection and Interaction with PyDirectInput
This Python script combines the power of the MediaPipe Pose model and the `pydirectinput` library to detect and recognize real-time body gestures and movements. It captures video input from the default camera (usually the webcam) and processes the frames to identify specific gestures and actions. Additionally, it uses `pydirectinput` to simulate keyboard events based on the recognized gestures.
